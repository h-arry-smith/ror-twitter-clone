# Ruby On Rails 5 Practice Projects - Project Two - Twitter Clone
This code is part of a larger project of 5 RoR practice projects of increasing difficulty.
The goal of this project is to develop, memorise and practice building non trivial applications in Rails.
I've been documenting my daily progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/h_arry_smith/status/1556562757910134786).
I'm publishing all the code from these projects on github in case they are ever of any use to another beginner.

## Project Aims
- Create a twitter clone with a feed, following and replies
- Use the devise gem to provide authentication
- Use a gem to add pagination to long lists
- Explore a more complex data model with has_many relationships

## Key Learnings
- Has many relationships can be difficult, and it helps to draw diagrams and choose the names that represent models and the relations carefully.
- The routes file feels a bit of a mess, and probably am not understanding how to model things as resources well, so futher research to be done here.
- Did a small exploration of turbo-frames, and seems like as opposed to my SPA experience, you very much sprinkle this in after, rather than designing around it from the ground up.
